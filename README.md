# are-you-es5
A package to help you find out which of your `node_modules` aren't ES5 so you can add them to your Webpack/Rollup/Parcel  transpilation steps. This is currently limited to checking the entrypoint scripts only.

## TODO

* [#1](https://github.com/obahareth/are-you-es5/issues/1) - Turn this into a CLI app.
* [#2](https://github.com/obahareth/are-you-es5/issues/2) - Also check against all scripts required by entrypoint script, this should work for all JS module types.
